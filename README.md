### Lighthouse Labs Week 4 Day 3 Assignments - Basic Camp - First Rails App

##### This is the first ever Rails app that I have built from the ground up. The idea behind this application is to build an open source version of the popular project management tool, BaseCamp. Since BaseCamp is based on a monthly subscription model, it would be good if there is an open source alternative. Anyone interested in using the application could fork it, implement any additional features and deploy it on their own environment.

I have tried to implement most of the core features in BaseCamp, including discussion board, todo list, and file sharing system for each project. I intend to add in additional features in later version, including calendar and real-time collaboration.

This application was built by going through the entire planning and designing process, including defining user stories, creating a list of all pages, as well as drawing up wireframes and entity relationshp diagrams. All of these documents can be found in the doc folder.

The project is still a work in progress as I will be adding in additional features and test cases as we go through TDD in class this week. It has also been deployed to Heroku and can be viewed at http://basic-camp.herokuapp.com.
